Add a Microsoft Teams sharing button to the Jetpack Sharing module

== Description ==


Important: for this plugin to work, you must activate [Jetpack](http://wordpress.org/plugins/jetpack/) first, and activate the Sharing module.

== Installation ==

1. Install the Jetpack plugin, connect the plugin to WordPress.com
2. Activate the Sharing module
3. Install the MS Teams Sharing for Jetpack plugin
4. Activate the plugin
5. Go to Settings > Sharing, and drag the Microsoft Teams button to the sharing area.
6. Enjoy! :)

This plugin is based largely on the work of jeherve. I know I could just add the Share URL to the Add an Additional Service link in Jetpack, but we needed this button available everywhere on a Multisite Network, so this simplifies the deployment.
