Tested up to: 5.4
Stable tag: 1.2.3

Add a Microsoft Teams sharing button to the Jetpack Sharing module

== Description ==


Important: for this plugin to work, you must activate [Jetpack](http://wordpress.org/plugins/jetpack/) first, and activate the Sharing module.

If you find issues, you can report them [here](http://wordpress.org/plugins/vk-sharing-jetpack/), or submit a pull request [on GitHub](https://github.com/jeherve/vk-sharing-jetpack/).

**Note:** Once you've added the button under Settings > Sharing, it won't appear on that page. Save your changes, and look at one of your posts to see the button in action.

== Installation ==

1. Install the Jetpack plugin, connect the plugin to WordPress.com
2. Activate the Sharing module
3. Install the VK.com Sharing for Jetpack plugin via the WordPress.org plugin repository, or via your dashboard
4. Activate the plugin
5. Go to Settings > Sharing, and drag the Microsoft Teams button to the sharing area.
6. Enjoy! :)

This plugin is based largely on the work of jeherve. I know I could just add the Share URL to the Add an Additional Service link in Jetpack, but we needed this button available everywhere on a Multisite Network.
